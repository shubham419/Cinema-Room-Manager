<h2>Right Rotation</h2>
<p></p><p>Right rotation is an operation that shifts each element of the list to the right.</p><p>If we right rotate the list {1,2,3,4,5} by 1 position, the new list will be {5,1,2,3,4}.<br/>Another example: if we right rotate the list {1,2,3,4,5} by 2 positions, the new list will be {4,5,1,2,3} because  <br/>{1,2,3,4,5} -&gt;  {5,1,2,3,4} -&gt;  {4,5,1,2,3}.</p><p>The first line of the input contains the number of elements in the list, <code class="java">N</code>.<br/>The next <code class="java">N</code> lines contain the elements of the list.<br/>The last line is a value that indicates the number of positions to rotate.</p><p>The output contains the shifted elements of the list. Separate the elements by a space.</p><p>If you want to move the list of 5 items by 11 positions, you can move it by 1 position. To calculate the necessary shifts, it is enough to perform a simple calculation of <code class="java">11 % 5</code>, the remainder of the division and will be the necessary number of shifts. Here is another example: shifting 25 elements by 973 positions. The required number of shifts will be <code class="java">973 % 25</code> equals 23. Such optimization will reduce the execution time of the program, as well as the amount of memory used.<br/>If you move without optimization, you fail the tests!</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>1</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">5 1 2 3 4</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
